# HOW TO USE (Quectel RM500Q only)   
## Step  
1. copy the PATH\_for\_NTU\_exp to the gloable PATH such as /usr/local/bin/ (Modify the relative PATH for the utilitis in this file if needed)
2. dial-qmi with the specific network interface
***
note: copy the interface naming file, 70-persistent-net.rules into /etc/udev/rules.d/ to rename the device interface   
	  without adding the support of specific module, default name of the network interface for the modules are wwan0,wwan1...   
	  set the configuration active: udevadm control --reload-rules && udevadm trigger

    query the current setting: use the -i [interface]  argu. only.   
### Command:   
    [bash] ./band-setting.sh -i [interface] -l [LTE band combination] -e [ENDC NR Band combination]  
    e.g. sudo ./band-setting.sh -i [interface] to query the current setting  
    e.g. sudo ./band-setting.sh -i [interface] -l 1:2:3:4  set the LTE band  
    e.g. sudo ./band-setting.sh -i [interface] -e 77:78:79 set the ENDC NR band   
    e.g. sudo  ./band-setting.sh -i [interface] -l 1:2:3:4  -e 77:78:79 set both LTE and ENDC NR band

## qc-at.sh

    Save the results into temp directory.   
    Filename will be the network interface.   
### Command:   
    [bash] ./get-cdc-wdm-num.sh -i [interface]    

## get-all-modem.py  
### Description:  
    To be removed in the future.

    Process the RM500Q modeules with network interface are qc00 to qc03.   
### Command:   
    [python3] ./get-all-modem.py  

## dial-qmi.sh   
### Description:  
    Dial the target qmi dev and network interface with target APN of "internet".  
    Flag -d to set as the default route. (arg is not needed)    
### Command:   
    [bash] ./dial-qmi.sh -i [interface] (-d)
